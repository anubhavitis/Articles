Crio launched a **Crio: Winter of Doing**, considered to by as India's largest tech externship program for developers. I got to know about this program through my college seniors, I applied for this program, and fortunately, I received an invitation for stage 1.

I have completed Stage 1 of this program, and in this article, I'll be sharing my adventurous journey with Crio

# Learning Bytes

CWOD's stage 1 was a complete package of an enormous learning experience. It consisted of 8 modules with hands-on experience, and a participant must complete these modules properly to get qualified for Stage 2.

CWOD referred to these modules as Byte, These bytes were important basic concepts of software development that every software developer must be equipped with. The list of these bytes are:

- <h6> HTTP </h6> Objective of this module was to get a clear understanding of how HTTP works and use tools like cURL & Postman to perform HTTP requests and analyze responses. 
    
    I have shared my notes of this module in an article, [here](https://dev.to/anubhavitis/http-fundamentals-5831) is a link to it.
- <h6> REST </h6> Objective of this module was to understand what REST APIs are, and how to make REST API calls. I have already been working with rest API for a long time, still, this module was a good learning experience for me.

    I have shared my notes of this module with some extra research, [here](https://dev.to/anubhavitis/apis-for-beginners-34ie) is a link to it.
- <h6> Linux Basics 1 </h6> This was the most interesting module of this stage, I always preferred Linux for my lappy, and I had a basic understanding of how Linux works. After this module, I love Linux more.
- <h6> Deploy app server in AWS </h6> Objective of this module was to help participants to launch their first virtual server in AWS, deploy the app backend server, and connect the mobile app to the app backend server. I must say, with 0 experience this module was most challenging for me.

    More the challenge, better the learning experience.
- <h6> Git Basics </h6>
    It's tough to imagine software development without version control systems. Git Basics bytes was a complete learning path for beginners and intermediates to get proficient with git and GitHub. Its hands-on experience equipped with GitLab and GitPod made the whole process very smooth.
- <h6> HTML and CSS </h6>
    HTML and CSS are the fundamentals of frontend development. The objective of this module was to get started using HTML for web pages, using CSS to style web pages, and create finally create the first static website.

- <h6> QPrep JavaScript </h6> JavaScript is one of the most famous language among developers. In this module, we learned Javascript ES6 features, and we learned them by solving several problems. For every problem, we had to construct a solution coded in JavaScript on Crio's editor.

- <h6> QProfile </h6> The final byte, and the most amazing one as well. This module needed learning from the rest of the previous bytes. Here we were supposed to construct a portfolio website fetching details from our GitHub through APIs and host in on GitHub. We were equipped with materials and the format of the profile.

# Fun activities

Stage 1 was a lot of fun, we had a lot of learning experiences and we had few fun activities as well. Some of them are listed below:

- <h6> Meme war</h6>One of the slack channels was filled with memes made by thousands of developers from various parts of the country. It was great to see how hilarious they were.
    I didn't make any meme but surely enjoyed a lot.

- <h6> Sherlock</h6> A puzzle game, with interesting problems about the internet and it's working. I did participate in this, and I wish it had more level to solve, cause I had a lot of fun doing it.

There were more activities since they weren't mandatory, I only participated in these two as per my convenience.
